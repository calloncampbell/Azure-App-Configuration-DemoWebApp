I setup this repository with multiple branches to show you what I did to end up with the final working solution (step3).

- *Master*: This is the original web app with nothing modified.
- *Step1*: Configured web app with Azure App Configuration.
- *Step2*: Configured web app to use Azure App Configuration.
- *Step3*: Enhanced to use bind Settings model to the Azure App Configuration.
